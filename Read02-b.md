# Git 
#### Git is DVCS that tack files by creating a snapshot and every time save happens to the user version of the project a snapshot of the file will be created and will be stored, This operation is called commit. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

#### Git relies on local operators as the project's history resides on the local disk the work that is done on the local operators can be seen on one device only and in case of the absence of wifi the user can continue working. In case any change happens on any file can be tracked by Git and make it extremely difficult for a snapshot of the user's file that is committed to be lost.

## Files in Git can reside in three main states: 
  1. committed: where data is securely stored in a local database 
  2. modified: Where File has been changed but not committed to the database 
  3.  staged: Where Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
